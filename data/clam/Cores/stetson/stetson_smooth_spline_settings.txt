Calibration curve: Marine13.14C
Age-depth model: smooth spline [type=4] with spar = 0.9 [smooth]
Weighted by the calibrated probabilities [wghts=1]
Calculations at 95% confidence ranges [prob=0.95]
Amount of iterations: 1000 [its]
Calendar age point estimates for depths based on weighted average of all age-depth curves [est=1]
Calendar scale used: cal BP [BCAD=FALSE] at a resolution of 1 yr [yrsteps]
Ages were calculated every 1 [every] mm [depth], from 0 [dmin] to 12 [dmax] mm

Dates ignored [ignore]: 2 (STET 1) 3 (STET 1.7)  

Goodness-of-fit (-log, lower is better):  711.38 
Any models with age-depth reversals were removed
